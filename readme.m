# GitPitch Product Repos

I started working on GitPitch as an open-source project back in 2016. The
original code for that project is still found in this repository. Since
mid 2017 I have been working full time developing a number of
[GitPitch products and services](#gitpitch-product-family) most of which
are maintained in private repositories. But I encourage users to report
issues and request features for all GitPitch products using GitHub
[issue tracking](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/issues) on this
repository.

As you will see from the following [CHANGELOG](#changelog) the GitPitch 
project is actively under development with fixes, features and even new
products being added all the time.
