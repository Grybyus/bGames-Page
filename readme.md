### What is Blended Games Framework?

> Video Games Developers. Adicction. Sensors. What?...

Video game addiction is a problem caused by the increase in gamers and facilities to play. Addiction causes serious problems for those who suffer, coming to interfere with the personal life and daily activities of the subject who uses them. Against this background the question arises about how to reconcile the development of an industry in constant growth with the well-being of people. It is in this context that the present project proposes and develops the concept of "b-Games", which aims to promote physical, social, cognitive and affective activities outside of video games while capturing data activities to be transformed into characteristics within video games.

- BGames is a software and a guide, aimed at gamedevelopers, observational researchers, that facilitates work with multimodal data.
- GitPitch Desktop lets you develop and present videogames with virtual or real interactions (like run with your smartphone and take your speed).
- Create and configure virtual profile for players with atributtes of them.
- Connect and use atributtes of virtual profile in videogames.
